# Data Science Projects

This repo contains the biweekly data science projects I made for Large Scale Data Mining class at UCLA.
Assignments, source codes and reports can be found in the corresponding project folders.

#### Project 1: Movie Recommender System
  I built and evaluated different recommendation models (KNN, NMF, MF and naive approaches) to predict the ratings of movies. MovieLens dataset is used.

#### Project 2: Regression Analysis and Twitter Sentiment Analysis
  - __Regression Analysis:__

    I did Regression Analysis on two different dataset with different models. 



  - __Player-Centric Time-based Sentiment Tracking and Prediction From Twitter Data.__

      Given tweets data on Superbowl 49, patriots and hawks hashtags, I tried to answer following questions:
    - For each fan group, can we track the average perceived emotion in the tweets about each player across time during the game?
    - Can we correlate these emotions with the game score in the given time interval?     
    - Given the tweets emotions about some players for 1 minutee interval can we predict who is winning the game?
